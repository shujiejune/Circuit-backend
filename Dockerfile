# Use an official Go image as the base for our build environment.
# Using a specific version ensures a consistent build environment.

# CGO_ENABLED=0 creates a statically linked binary (no external dependencies).
# -o /app/server creates an output file named 'server' in the /app directory.

# --- Stage 2: Final Stage ---

# 'scratch' is an empty image, making it extremely small and secure.
# 'alpine' is a very small Linux distribution if you need a shell or other tools.
